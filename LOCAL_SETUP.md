# Instructions for setting up a local environment to run labs in place of GitHub Codespace


<br><br>

These instructions will guide you through configuring a local environment that you can use to do the labs. 

<br><br>


**1. Use Git to clone this repository down to your machine with a command like the following.**

```
git clone https://github.com/skilldevai/ae-security
```

<br><br>

**2. Open up the cloned project in VS Code.** 

There are multiple ways to do this: 
- You can drag and drop the project directory onto VS Code.
- You can open VS Code and open the folder from its menu.
- You can simply change into the cloned directory and run the command "code ."

```
cd ae-security
code .
```

<br><br>

**3. Once you open the folder/project in VS Code, VS Code should detect the devcontainer setup and prompt you about running it as a development container (usually in lower right corner). Do not choose this option. Instead just click on the "x" to close the dialog and ignore that option.**

<br>


**4. Run the commands below to setup the python env and startup Ollama.**

```
scripts/pysetup.sh py_env && scripts/startup_ollama.sh
```

**5. Allow the setup processing to run automatically. (May take up to 10 minutes for some projects).**

<br>

![Setup](./images/local-6-b.png?raw=true "Setup")

<br><br>


**6. You are now ready to run the labs in your local environment!**

**NOTE: For any paths in the labs that reference `/workspaces/ae-security` you should use the directory of your clone instead.
